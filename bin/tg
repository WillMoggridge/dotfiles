#!/usr/bin/env bash

### CAN THIS BE MORE GENERIC?
# A global file sync with file and command configs as yaml or cli flags
#
# taskfile:
#     filename: Taskfile.yml
#     command: DIRECTORY={{pwd}} tf

# Use and write task files to a sync folder
# Look up taskfile from

# Get pwd folder of nearest taskfile
# Strip $HOME?
# Append to $SYNC_FOLDER/

# Template defaults to including global .config/TaskFile.yml

# TODO LATER:


##### Commands
# sync - Parse commands locally
# status - Check for updates
# which - Show
# download - downoad repo
# upload - Upload repo
# new [DIR] - Create Taskfile for this folder from template, with location confirmation
# edit [DIR] - Edit file (or nearest file with confirmation - maybe number list)
# template edit [DIR] - Edit template file $SYNC_FOLDER/_TEMPLATES/


##### Argument management
# Check for sync to handle in script, otherwise pass through


##### Using syned files
# taskfile is hardcoded, can a global directory be set?
